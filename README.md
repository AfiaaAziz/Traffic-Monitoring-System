# Traffic Monitoring System

## Overview
This project, **Traffic Monitoring System**, is a **semester project** for the **Calculus and Analytical Geometry course**. It utilizes mathematical concepts such as integration to analyze and visualize traffic flow over a time interval. Through the power of Python, this project combines real-time graphical representations, animations, and computational accuracy to demonstrate the practical application of calculus in solving real-world problems.
